# ylide

These ipynbs implement virtual high throughput screening of ylide redox mediators. <br>

They construct molecular libraries using RDkit to manipulate functional groups and chemical structure. `QMkit` is used to generate the 3D coordinates and QM calculation scripts for every molecule in the libaray.
Currently, 60,000 DFT calculations are set up to run on MIT's Supercloud resources using Gaussian Software.
